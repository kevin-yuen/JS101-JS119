key, value:
0 - Spock - sp
1 - Lizard - l
2 - Rock - r
3 - Paper - p
4 - Scissors - sc

Data structure for key/value:
obj = [
    {"sp": "spock"},
    {"l": "lizard"},
    {"r": "rock"},
    {"p": "paper"},
    {"sc": "scissors"}
]

Win if one of the followings satisfy...
4 > 3 > 2 > 1 > 0
4 > 1
3 > 0
(special handling) 0 > 4
(special handling) 1 > 3
(special handling) 0 > 2
(special handling) 2 > 4

Implementation steps:
1. User input a key for the choice he wants to select
2. Leverage the key to map for the value and index position
3. Leverage the index position for the decisioning logic
3a. Decisioning Logic:
IF human > computer
AND the difference (i.e. human - computer) is 1 or 3
THEN human win

IF human < computer
AND the difference (i.e. human - computer) is -2 or -4
THEN human win

IF human = computer
THEN tie game

ELSE
human lose
